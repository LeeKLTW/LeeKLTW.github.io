Different from the English-like languages whose words are separated naturally, 
it is necessary to segment character sequence as word sequence in many East
Asian languages, such as Chinese. Chinese word segmentation(CWS) is the task of 
splitting Chinese text (a sequence of Chinese characters) into words. It's an 
important supporting task for other NLP tasks.
